# Customer_Churn_Analysis

In this Project , we take Bank Customer Churn dataset and go through the end-to-end process of developing and publishing the Customer Churn Analysis report in Power BI, including the following steps:
1. Data Connection
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Modeling and Analysis
4. Data Visualisation
5. Report Sharing and distribution

Objective:

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer churn in a bank dataset. The primary objective is to identify patterns in customer behavior, credit scores, account balances, and product ownership that contribute to customer attrition. The visualized insights enable stakeholders to design effective retention strategies and personalize engagement efforts.

Using Power BI's dynamic visual capabilities, the dashboard provides an intuitive interface to interact with and explore different dimensions such as gender, age, credit score, and geographical location. The outcome of this project highlights the importance of business intelligence tools in uncovering hidden patterns, driving strategic decisions, and preventing potential revenue loss due to churn.




📌 Key Highlights from the Dashboard:

✅ Gender-wise distribution shows a slight skew toward female customers (54.57%).
✅ Balanced ratio between Active (51.51%) and Inactive (48.49%) customers.
✅ Majority of users (70.5%) own credit cards, which indicates financial engagement.
🌍 Country-wise split shows France leads (50.14%), followed by Germany and Spain.
📦 Product 1 and Product 2 are the most preferred products among customers.
📊Churn rate currently stands at 20.4%, a critical metric for customer retention.

📉 Churn rate spikes significantly in the 51–60 age group, despite lower population.
💳 Customers with credit scores ≤400 are at the highest churn risk.
💰 High churn seen in accounts with zero balance or 10k–100k balance range.
📐 Interactive dashboard enables slicing by age, balance, credit scores, and more.


 🧠In this Analysis Approach:

✅ Power BI enables fast, intuitive, and interactive visual storytelling.
✅ Dashboards are drillable and dynamic for deep-dive exploration.
✅ Insights support data-backed decisions for churn mitigation strategies.
✅ Helps in identifying high-risk segments and customizing engagement accordingly.
✅ Ideal for marketing, CRM, and data strategy teams to align business actions.
